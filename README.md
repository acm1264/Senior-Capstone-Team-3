## About
The visual workout planner is a single-page React web application made by Andrew Maurice, Tram Doan, Chad Bealer, Jeremy Choyce, and Caitlin Burke. This app is the team's 2021 Senior Capstone project.
<br>
This web application, hosted at (LINK TO BE PROVIDED ONCE ESTABLISHED), is designed to organize exercises based on muscle categories for anyone, novice or expert, to use when planning their workouts. The app features two SVG models of the human body muscular structure, where each muscle can be clicked to show/hide exercises using that muscle.
<br>
The exercise details are stored in a custom database our team designed using (TO BE DETERMINED). 

## Setup
To run the Rreact web app locally, npm will be required, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
